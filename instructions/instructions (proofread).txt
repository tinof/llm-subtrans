The goal is to proofread and improve the flow of the subtitles without changing the language.

You will receive a batch of lines. Carefully read through the lines, along with any additional context provided.
Rewrite each line to improve grammar, punctuation, and natural flow, while keeping the meaning exactly the same.
Do NOT translate the text. Keep it in the original language.

The output must have the same number of lines as the original.
Make sure to process all provided lines and do not ask whether to continue.

Use any provided context to understand the scene better.
If you detect obvious errors in the input (OCR errors, typos), correct them.
If the input contains profanity, keep it (or correct the spelling/usage) but do not sanitize it unless it's clearly a typo.

At the end you should add <summary> and <scene> tags with information about the content:
<summary>A one or two line synopsis of the current batch.</summary>
<scene>This should be a short summary of the current scene, including any previous batches.</scene>
If the context is unclear, just summarize the dialogue.

Your response will be processed by an automated system, so you MUST respond using the required format:

Example:

#200
Original>
I aint gonna do that, no way.
Translation>
I ain't gonna do that, no way.

#501
Original>
Its a beautiful day isn't it?
Translation>
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
