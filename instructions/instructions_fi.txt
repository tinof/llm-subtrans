### prompt
Please translate the following subtitles[ for movie] to Finnish.

### instructions
The goal is to accurately translate subtitles into Finnish while maximizing readability, flow, and compactness.

You will receive a batch of lines for translation. Read the context first. Translate each line separately into Finnish, aiming for concise, fluent lines that are instantly comprehensible on screen.

CRITICAL RULES
- The translation MUST have the same number of lines as the original
- Never merge or split lines (timing must remain aligned)
- REMOVE all fillers/disfluencies (öö, äh, em, öhm, niinku, tota, tavallaan, siis, you know, kind of, like, etc.)
- Keep lines short: target ≤ 35–40 characters per line; two lines max per subtitle
- Prefer short, crisp phrasing over literal verbosity; keep the core meaning

REGISTER & STYLE (FINNISH)
- Default to neutral, contemporary Finnish (kirjakieli for subtitles)
- Avoid colloquial pronouns and forms (mä/sä, oon/oot, tää/toi, just, niinku) unless the speaker’s style CLEARLY demands it
  - Prefer omitting pronouns when obvious from the verb (Menen vs. Mä menen)
  - If a character’s speech is explicitly slangy, light colloquial touches are acceptable
- Use “minä/sinä” forms sparingly; omit if context is clear. Use “teitittely” only when the situation clearly requires formality
- Do not split Finnish compounds (autokorjaamo is correct; NOT “auto korjaamo”). Use shorter synonyms or rephrase to keep lines short
- Keep established loanwords (email, selfie, deadline) where natural

COMPACTNESS & FLOW
- Remove words that don’t add meaning in subtitle context (really, actually, just, kind of, you know → drop unless semantically needed)
- Prefer verb-centric, frontloaded structures; drop “että” when safe
- Combine meaning efficiently (avoid tautology and self‑explanations)
- Use ellipses (…) only for deliberate dramatic effect, not hesitation
- Keep punctuation clean and unobtrusive; avoid clutter

TRANSLATION APPROACH
- Idioms: translate the intended meaning with natural Finnish equivalents
- Cultural references: adapt only if needed for comprehension
- Profanity: match intensity with natural Finnish usage (e.g., “fuck” → “vittu”)
- Names: keep original spelling unless established Finnish exonym exists
- Correct obvious source errors using context; do not invent content

QUALITY CHECKS FOR EACH LINE
- Is it instantly readable at a glance? If not, shorten
- Does it avoid fillers and unnecessary discourse markers?
- Is the register appropriate (neutral by default; limited slang only when clearly signaled)?
- Are compounds written correctly? (No artificial splits)
- Does it align 1:1 with the source lines?

At the end you should add <summary> and <scene> tags with information about the translation:

<summary>A one or two line synopsis of the current batch.</summary>
<scene>This should be a short summary of the current scene, including any previous batches.</scene>

If the context is unclear, just summarize the dialogue.

### retry_instructions
There was an issue with the previous translation.

Please translate the subtitles again, ensuring each line is translated SEPARATELY, EVERY line has a corresponding translation, and the output is compact, filler‑free, and neutral in register unless the context clearly requires colloquial language.

Do NOT merge or split lines. Remove hesitation/filler words. Keep lines short and immediately readable.
