# LLM-Subtrans
LLM-Subtrans is an open source subtitle translator that uses LLMs as a translation service. It can translate subtitles between any language pairs supported by the language model.

The application supports multiple subtitle formats through a pluggable system. Currently `.srt`, `.ssa`/`.ass` and `.vtt` files are supported.

Note: LLM-Subtrans requires an active internet connection. Subtitles are sent to the provider's servers for translation, so their privacy policy applies.

## Installation
For most users the packaged release is the easiest way to use the program. Download a package from [the releases page](https://github.com/machinewrapped/llm-subtrans/releases), unzip to a folder and run `gui-subtrans`. You will be prompted for some basic settings on first run.

If you want to use the command line tools, modify the code or just prefer to have more control over the setup you will need to [install from source](#installing-from-source).

### Windows
Every release is packaged for Windows as (**gui-subtrans-x.x.x.zip**).

### MacOS
Packaged builds are (usually) provided for MacOS with Apple Silicon (**gui-subtrans-x.x.x.macos-arm64.zip**). If you have an Intel Mac you will need to [install from source](#installing-from-source).

### Linux
Prebuilt Linux packages are not provided so you will need to [install from source](#installing-from-source).

## Translation Providers

### OpenRouter
https://openrouter.ai/privacy

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a service which aggregates [models](https://openrouter.ai/models) from a wide range of providers. You will need an [OpenRouter API Key](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) to use the service, and a credit balance (though some quite capable models are provided free of charge).

You can choose to let OpenRouter select the model automatically (the "Use Default Model" setting in the GUI or `--auto` on the command line) or you can specify a specific model. Model preferences can also be specified in the OpenRouter dashboard.

Since hundreds of models are available they are grouped by model family. By default the list of available models is pulled from the "Translation" category, though this excludes many models that are perfectly capable of translation (including most free options).

### Google Gemini
https://ai.google.dev/terms

**Please note that regions restrictions may apply: https://ai.google.dev/available_regions**

Gemini 2.5 Flash is perhaps the leading model for translation speed and fluency at time of writing, despite some censorship, and Preview models are often free to use.

You will need a Google Gemini API key from https://ai.google.dev/ or from a project created on https://console.cloud.google.com/. You must ensure that Generative AI is enabled for the api key and project.

Unfortunately Gemini will refuse to translate content that contains certain words or phrases, even with minimal safety settings. If you hit this you will need to use another provider or split the batch and manually translate the offending lines.

### OpenAI
https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

You will need an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to use OpenAI's GPT models. If the API key is associated with a free trial the translation speed will be *severely* restricted.

You can use the custom api_base parameter to access a custom OpenAI instance (or any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint, though the Custom Server option gives you more control).

You can use an **OpenAI Azure** installation as a translation provider, but this is only advisable if you know what you're doing - in which case hopefully it will be clear how to configure the Azure provider settings.

### DeepSeek
https://platform.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Open%20Platform%20Terms%20of%20Service.html

You will need a DeepSeek API key from https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys to use this provider.

- **API Base**: You can optionally specify a custom URL, e.g. if you are hosting your own DeepSeek instance. If this is not set, the official DeepSeek API endpoint will be used.

- **Model**: The default model is `deepseek-chat`, which is recommended for translation tasks. `deepseek-reasoner` may produce better results for source subtitles with OCR or transcription errors as it will spend longer trying to guess what the error is.

DeepSeek is quite simple to set up and offers reasonable performance at a very low price, though translation does not seem to be its strongest point.

### Anthropic
https://support.anthropic.com/en/collections/4078534-privacy-legal

You will need an Anthropic API key from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys to use Claude as a provider. Translation is not Claude's strongest suit, and the API is expensive compared to others.

The API has strict [rate limits](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/rate-limits) based on your credit tier, both on requests per minutes and tokens per day.

### Mistral
https://mistral.ai/terms/

You will need a Mistral API key from https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/ to use this provider.

- **Server URL**: If you are using a custom deployment of the Mistral API, you can specify the server URL using the `--server_url` argument.

- **Model**: `mistral-large-latest` is recommended for translation. Smaller models tend to perform poorly and may not follow the system instructions well.

Mistral AI is straightforward to set up, but its performance as a translator is not particularly good.

### Custom Server
LLM-Subtrans can interface directly with any server that supports an OpenAI compatible API, including locally hosted models e.g. [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/).

This is mainly for research and you should not expect particularly good results from local models. LLMs derive much of their power from their size, so the small, quantized models you can run on a consumer GPU are likely to produce poor translations, fail to generate valid responses or get stuck in endless loops. If you find a model that reliably producess good results, please post about it in the Discussions area!

Chat and completion endpoints are supported - you should configure the settings and endpoint based on the model the server is running (e.g. instruction tuned models will probably produce better results using the completions endpoint rather than chat). The prompt template can be edited in the GUI if you are using a model that requires a particular format - make sure to include at least the {prompt} tag in the template, as this is where the subtitles that need translating in each batch will be filled in!

### Amazon Bedrock
https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/

**Bedrock is not recommended for most users**: The setup process is complex, requiring AWS credentials, proper IAM permissions, and region configuration. Additionally, not all models on Bedrock support translation tasks or offer reliable results. Bedrock support will not be included in pre-packaged versions - if you can handle setting up AWS, you can handle installing llm-subtrans [from source](#installing-from-source).

To use Bedrock, you must:
  1. Create an **IAM user** or **role** with appropriate permissions (e.g., `bedrock:InvokeModel`, `bedrock:ListFoundationModels`).
  2. Ensure the model you wish to use is accessible in your selected AWS region and [enabled for the IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html).

## Installing from source
If you want to use the command line tools or modify the program, you will need to have Python 3.10+ and pip installed on your system, then follow these steps.

Clone the LLM-Subtrans repository to your local machine using the following command or your preferred tool:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/machinewrapped/llm-subtrans.git
    ```

### Install with pipx (Recommended)

[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) is the recommended way to install CLI Python applications. It creates an isolated environment automatically and adds the command-line tools to your PATH.

```sh
# Install pipx if you don't have it
pip install --user pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Install llm-subtrans with commonly used providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
pipx install "llm-subtrans[openai,gemini,claude]"

# Or install with all providers
pipx install "llm-subtrans[openai,gemini,claude,mistral,bedrock,azure]"

# Or minimal install (OpenRouter only - no additional dependencies)
pipx install llm-subtrans

# For development (editable install from local clone)
cd llm-subtrans
pipx install -e ".[openai,gemini,claude]"
```

After installation, all command-line tools will be available directly:

```sh
# Use any provider-specific command directly
gpt-subtrans --model gpt-5-mini -l Spanish subtitle.srt
gemini-subtrans --model gemini-2.5-flash-latest -l French subtitle.srt
claude-subtrans --model claude-3-5-haiku-latest -l German subtitle.srt

# Or use the universal llm-subtrans command with OpenRouter
llm-subtrans --auto -l Japanese subtitle.srt
```

To upgrade or uninstall:

```sh
# Upgrade to latest version
pipx upgrade llm-subtrans

# Reinstall with different extras
pipx uninstall llm-subtrans
pipx install "llm-subtrans[openai,gemini,claude]"

# Uninstall
pipx uninstall llm-subtrans
```

### Setup scripts

The easiest setup method is to run the unified installation script:
- **Windows**: Run `install.bat`
- **MacOS/Linux**: Run `install.sh`

These scripts will create a virtual environment and offer **install with GUI** or **install command line only** options, with additional options to add support for specific providers. The script will guide you through the setup and generate command scripts to launch the application.

During the installing process, you can choose to input an API key for each selected provider when prompted, which will be saved in a .env file so that you don't need to provide it every time you run the program. This is largely redundant if you only plan to use the GUI, as keys can be saved in the app settings.

### Manual configuration
**If you ran an install script you can skip the remaining steps. Continue reading _only_ if you want to configure the environment manually instead.**

1. Create a new file named .env in the root directory of the project. Add any required settings for your chosen provider to the .env file like this:
    ```sh
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your_openrouter_api_key>
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
    GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
    AZURE_API_KEY=<your_azure_api_key>
    CLAUDE_API_KEY=<your_claude_api_key>
    ```

    If you are using Azure:

    ```sh
    AZURE_API_BASE=<your api_base, such as https://something.openai.azure.com>
    AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<deployment_name>
    ```

    If you are using Bedrock:
    ```sh
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
    AWS_REGION=your-region
    ```

    For OpenAI reasoning models you can set the reasoning effort (default is low):
    ```sh
    OPENAI_REASONING_EFFORT=low/medium/high
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment for the project by running the following command in the root folder to create a local environment for the Python interpreter (optional, but highly recommended to avoid dependency conflicts with other Python applications):

    ```sh
    python -m venv envsubtrans
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command for your operating system. You will need to do this each time before running the app.

    ```sh
    .\envsubtrans\Scripts\activate      # Windows
    source ./envsubtrans/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
    ```

4. Install the project (add the -e switch for an editable install if you want to modify the code):

    ```sh
    pip install -e .                   # Minimal install of command line tools with support for OpenRouter or Custom Server
    pip install -e ".[gui]"            # Core module and default provider with GUI module
    pip install -e ".[gui,openai,gemini,claude,mistral,bedrock]"   # Full install with optional providers (delete to taste)
    ```

## Usage
The program works by dividing the subtitles up into batches and sending each one to the translation service in turn. 

It can potentially make many API calls for each subtitle file, depending on the batch size. Speed heavily depends on the selected model.

By default The translated subtitles will be written to a new file in the same directory with the target langugage appended to the original filename.

### GUI
The [Subtrans GUI](https://github.com/machinewrapped/llm-subtrans/wiki/GUI#gui-subtrans) is the best and easiest way to use the program. 

After installation, launch the GUI with the `gui-subtrans` command or shell script, and hopefully the rest should be self-explanatory.

See the project wiki for further details on how to use the program.

### Command Line
LLM-Subtrans can be used as a console command or shell script. The install scripts create a cmd or sh file in the project root for each provider, which will take care of activating the virtual environment and calling the corresponding translation script.

The most basic usage is:
```sh
# Use OpenRouter with automatic model selection
llm-subtrans --auto -l <language> <path_to_subtitle_file>

# Use OpenRouter with a specific model
llm-subtrans --model google/gemini-2.5-flash -l <language> <path_to_subtitle_file>

# Convert format while translating (ASS to SRT in this example)
llm-subtrans -l <language> -o output.srt input.ass

# Use any server with an OpenAI-compatible API
llm-subtrans -s <server_address> -e <endpoint> -k <api_key> -l <language> <path_to_subtitle_file>

# Use specific providers
gpt-subtrans --model gpt-5-mini --target_language <target_language> <path_to_subtitle_file>
gemini-subtrans --model gemini-2.5-flash-latest --target_language <target_language> <path_to_subtitle_file>
claude-subtrans --model claude-3-5-haiku-latest --target_language <target_language> <path_to_subtitle_file>

# List supported subtitle formats
llm-subtrans --list-formats

# Batch process files in a folder tree (activate the virtual environment first)
python scripts/batch_translate.py ./subtitles ./translated --provider openai --model gpt-5-mini --apikey sk-... --language Spanish
```

The output format is inferred from file extensions. To convert between formats, provide an output path with the desired extension.

If the target language is not specified the default is English.

Other options that can be specified on the command line are detailed below.

## Project File

**Note**: Project files are enabled by default in the GUI.

The `--project` argument or `PROJECT_FILE` .env setting control whether a project file will be written to disc for the command line.

If enabled, a file will be created with the `.subtrans` extension when a subtitle file is loaded, containing details of the project. It will be updated as the translation progresses. Writing a project file allows, amongst other things, resuming a translation that was interrupted. It is highly recommended.

```sh
# Use OpenRouter and create a persistent project
llm-subtrans --project --auto -l <language> <path_to_subtitle_file>

# Use OpenRouter and resume a persistent project
llm-subtrans --project --auto -l <language> <path_to_subtrans_file>
llm-subtrans --project --auto -l <language> <path_to_subtitle_file>  # Project file will be detected automatically if it is in the same folder
```

## Format Conversion
LLM-Subtrans is primarily a translation application, and format conversion is probably best handled by dedicated tools, but the option exists to read one format and write another.

```sh
# Use OpenRouter and convert from .ass to .srt
llm-subtrans --project --auto -l <language> -o <path_to_output_file.srt> <path_to_subtitle_file.ass>
```

## Advanced usage

There are a number of command-line arguments that offer more control over the translation process.

To use any of these arguments, add them to the command-line after the path to the source file. For example:

```sh
llm-subtrans path/to/my/subtitles.srt --moviename "My Awesome Movie" --ratelimit 10 --substitution cat::dog
```

Default values for many settings can be set in the .env file, using a NAME_IN_CAPS format. See Options.py and the various Provider_XXX files for the full list.

- `-l`, `--target_language`:
  The language to translate the subtitles to.

- `-o`, `--output`:
  Specify a filename for the translated subtitles.

- `--project`:
  Read or Write a project file for the subtitles being translated (see above for details)

- `--ratelimit`:
  Maximum number of requests to the translation service per minute (mainly relevant if you are using an OpenAI free trial account).

- `--moviename`:
  Optionally identify the source material to give context to the translator.

- `--description`:
  A brief description of the source material to give further context. Less is generally more here, or the AI can start improvising.

- `--name`, `--names`:
  Optionally provide (a list of) names to use in the translation (more powerful AI models are more likely to actually use them).

- `--substitution`:
  A pair of strings separated by `::`, to substitute in either source or translation, or the name of a file containing a list of such pairs.

- `--scenethreshold`:
  Number of seconds between lines to consider it a new scene.

- `--minbatchsize`:
  Minimum number of lines to consider starting a new batch to send to the translator.
  Higher values typically result in faster and cheaper translations but increase the risk of desyncs.

- `--maxbatchsize`:
  Maximum number of lines before starting a new batch is compulsory.
  This needs to take into account the token limit for the model being used, but the "optimal" value depends on many factors, so experimentation is encouraged.
  Larger batches are more cost-effective but increase the risk of the AI desynchronising, triggering expensive retries.

- `--preprocess`:
  Preprocess the subtitles prior to batching.
  This performs various actions to prepare the subtitles for more efficient translation, e.g. splitting long (duration) lines into multiple lines.
  Mainly intended for subtitles that have been automatically transcribed with e.g. Whisper.

- `--postprocess`:
  Post-process translated subtitles.
  Performs various actions like adding line breaks to long lines and normalising dialogue tags after a translation request.

- `--instruction`:
  An additional instruction for the AI indicating how it should approach the translation.

- `--instructionfile`:
  Name/path of a file to load AI system instructions from (otherwise the default instructions.txt is used).

- `--maxlines`:
  Maximum number of batches to process. To end the translation after a certain number of lines, e.g. to check the results.

- `--temperature`:
  A higher temperature increases the random variance of translations. Default 0.

- `--reload`:
  Subtitles will be reloaded from the source file rather than using the subtitles saved in the project (note: this implies `--project`)

- `--retranslate`:
  Existing translations will be ignored and all subtitles will be retranslated (note: this implies `--project`)

- `--reparse`:
  Existing translations will not be sent to the translator again but the translator's response will be reprocessed to extract the translations.
  This is mainly useful after a bug fix release, but can also be used to reset translations that have been hand-edited (note: this implies `--project`)

- `--preview`:
  Subtitles will be loaded and batched and the translation flow will run, but no calls to the translator will be made. Only useful for debug.

### Proxy

If you need to use proxy in your location, you can use socks proxy by using command line

```sh
python3 gpt-subtrans.py <path_to_subtitle_file> --target_language <target_language> --proxy socks://127.0.0.1:1089
```
Remember to change the local port to yours and turn on your proxy tools such as v2ray, naiveproxy and clash.

### batch process

You can process files with the following directory structure：

      #   -SRT
      #   --fold1
      #   ---1.srt
      #   ---2.srt
      #   ...
      #   --fold2
      #   ---1.srt
      #   ---2.srt
      #   ...

Use the `batch_translate.py` script to process multiple subtitle files:

You can modify the `DEFAULT_OPTIONS` values directly in the script file, or use a combination of script defaults and command line overrides.

```sh
# Preview mode to test settings without making API calls
python scripts/batch_translate.py --preview

# Basic usage with command line arguments
python scripts/batch_translate.py ./subtitles ./translated --provider openai --model gpt-5-mini --apikey sk-... --language Spanish

# Override output format
python scripts/batch_translate.py ./subtitles ./translated --provider openai --output-format srt

# Use additional options
python scripts/batch_translate.py ./subtitles ./translated --provider openai --option max_batch_size=40 --option preprocess_subtitles=false
```

### Developers
It is recommended to use an IDE such as Visual Studio Code to run the program when installed from source, and set up a launch.json file to specify the arguments.

Note: Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you work on the project.

## Version History

Version 1.3 added OpenRouter as the default translation service, opening up access to many more

Version 1.2 added localization for the GUI and support for the GPT-5 model line.

Version 1.1 added support for a more flexible translation format for use with custom instructions.

Version 1.0 is (ironically) a minor update, updating the major version to 1.0 because the project has been stable for some time.

Version 0.7 introduced optional post-processing of translated subtitles to try to fix some of the common issues with LLM-translated subtitles (e.g. adding line breaks), along with new default instructions that tend to produce fewer errors.

Version 0.6 changes the architecture to a provider-based system, allowing multiple AI services to be used as translators.
Settings are compartmentalised for each provider. For the intial release the only supported provider is **OpenAI**.

Version 0.5 adds support for gpt-instruct models and a refactored code base to support different translation engines. For most users, the recommendation is still to use the **gpt-3.5-turbo-16k** model with batch sizes of between (10,100) lines, for the best combination of performance/cost and translation quality.

Version 0.4 features significant optimisations to the GUI making it more responsive and usable, along with numerous bug fixes.

Version 0.3 featured a major effort to bring the GUI up to full functionality and usability, including adding options dialogs and more, plus many bug fixes.

Version 0.2 employs a new prompting approach that greatly reduces desyncs caused by GPT merging together source lines in the translation. This can reduce the naturalness of the translation when the source and target languages have very different grammar, but it provides a better base for a human to polish the output.

The instructions have also been made more detailed, with multiple examples of correct output for GPT to reference, and the generation of summaries has been improved so that GPT is better able to understand the context of the batch it is translating. Additionally, double-clicking a scene or batch now allows the summary to be edited by hand, which can greatly improve the results of a retranslation and of subsequent batches or scenes. Individually lines can also be edited by double-clicking them.
